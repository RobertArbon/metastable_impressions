How to generate the visualizations: 

1. download trajectory file from Chodera's [](https://osf.io/2h6p4/files/) and place in this directory. 
2. Use the jupyter notebook to align the trajectory and save as pdb. 
3. run `vmd -e default_visualisation.vmd`
4. make a directory called `target_samples`
5. open a `tk console` in VMD. 
6. `source generate_target_images.vmd` in the console
7. Wait!
